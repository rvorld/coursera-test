<h2>Hi there</h2>
<h3>Welcome Everyone</h3>
<p>
Okay, so here I am in Mac OS, and I'm actually using the latest one as of this recording, which is El Capitan. And let's go ahead and, I already downloaded Sublime Text. So, let's go ahead and double click that and, and install that real quick. Very easy it just opens up this window. We just drag it to my applications folder. And after about a second it's done. Just verify that it's actually in here.</p> <p> It is, so I can close that, close that, and go ahead eject the mount. And actually now if I do command space, and start typing some sublime it will come up Sublime Text right there. I said yes, I want to open it for the first time. And actually, I want to drag it right next to Chrome, that I already installed.
